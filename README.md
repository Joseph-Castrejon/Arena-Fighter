# LibRPG

This project aims to provide runtime libraries that implement mechanisms for a role-playing adventure game. The master branch includes a solution file containing seperate C# projects. The scope of the libraries are the following:

* Game Mechanics : Combat, Spellcasting, Movement, Simple NPC and World Interactions
* Character Classes : Archer, Barbarian, Wizard, etc...
* Character Races : Human, Dwarf, Elf, etc.. 
* Equipment : Swords, Bows, Magical Scrolls, Treasures

The code is open-source and released under the 3-Clause BSD License. Other game aspects and lore will not be covered in this project. If you wish to add your own subclasses, equipment, or game mechanics you are free to use the libraries as a starting point. This project does not aim to be a complete game engine and should be used alongside an existing game engine or a game engine created independently.
